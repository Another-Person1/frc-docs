The Limelight SystemCore is designed specifically with FIRST in mind. The Systemcore is powered by a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 (CM5), and uses a Raspberry Pi RP2350 for reconfigurable I/O.

The SystemCore is a reconfigurable robotics controller that includes built-in ports for Controller Area Network Flexible Data-Rate (CAN-FD), Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C), USB, Ethernet, and reconfigurable I/O for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), Digital I/O, and Analog Inputs to quickly connect the common sensors and actuators used in robotics. The controller features three status LEDs, a user-replaceable OLED display, and an onboard IMU. It has an onboard quad-core ARM real-time Cortex‑A76 processor.

The SystemCore comes shipped with 4 GB of RAM and 16 GB of EMMC storage, and also comes with a M.2 A+E key 2230 slot for connecting compatible peripherals over a PCIe 2.0 connection.

Detailed information on the SystemCore can be found in the [SystemCore technical specifications](https://downloads.limelightvision.io/documents/systemcore_specifications_june15_2025_alpha.pdf).
